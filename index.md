# The Scientific Computing Group at CWI
The Scientific Computing group at CWI develops efficient mathematical methods to simulate and predict real-world phenomena with inherent uncertainties. Our two main research themes are **scientific machine learning** and **uncertainty quantification**, and the topics within these themes are neural ODEs, closure models for turbulence, reduced-order models, discretization techniques, stochastic parameterizations, generative models, data assimilation.

Our official CWI page with general information can be found [here](https://www.cwi.nl/en/groups/scientific-computing/). On the current page, you can find more detailed information such as the software that we develop in the group and other useful information such as the material used in the [semester programmes](https://github.com/SemesterProgramme-SciML) that we organize. Note the [upcoming semester programme 2024](https://www.cwi.nl/en/events/cwi-research-semester-programs/research-semester-programs-in-2024/uncertainty-quantification-for-high-dimensional-problems/)!
