# ENW XS funding for generative AI for physics simulations
Turbulence is everywhere, from the swirl of smoke in air to the turbulent flows of gas in galaxies. Yet despite its ubiquity, it remains one of the most difficult phenomena to simulate. Benjamin Sanderse, head of the Scientific Computing group at CWI, has received a research grant from the Dutch Research Council (NWO) to explore artificial intelligence as a tool to tackle this chaotic challenge.

Sanderse has been awarded a €50,000 Open Competition Domain Science – XS grant, which is intended to support promising ideas and to facilitate innovative and more speculative initiatives. The proposed research is both ground-breaking and high-risk. What counts is that all results, whether positive or negative, must contribute to the advancement of science.

With his research proposal, Sanderse aims to discover the hidden mathematical equations behind turbulence using a class of models known as neural stochastic differential equations.
