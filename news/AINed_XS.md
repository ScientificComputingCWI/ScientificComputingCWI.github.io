# AiNed XS funding for generative AI for physics simulations
In this project, proposed by Benjamin Sanderse and Nikolaj Mücke of CWI’s Scientific Computing group, a physics-aware generative AI model capable of generating physics simulations will be developed.

The [National Growth Fund programme AiNed](https://ained.nl/) allows promising ideas and innovative and speculative initiatives in the artificial intelligence domain to be explored. The projects are designed in collaboration with at least one European collaborative partner organization.

With this funding of 80K euros, CWI will launch the following project in collaboration with the Imperial College London; I-X Centre for AI in Science and the Technical University of Munich (TUM); School of Computation, Information and Technology.
